To do:

- Remove dependency on steam-client and remove ability to specify a custom one. Instead, build that functionality in directly.
- Add promise support for all methods that take a callback
- Add `err` to all callbacks that don't have it already

Breaking:

- Now requires node 6 (up from node 4)
- Removed deprecated and non-functional method `disableTwoFactor`; use [steamcommunity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamcommunity) instead
- Removed deprecated method `generateAuthCode`; use [steam-totp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) instead
- enableTwoFactor now has an `err` as its first callback argument
- `server_time` in enableTwoFactor callback data is now a number instead of a string

Before publishing:

- Create v3 branch pointing to last v3 release
