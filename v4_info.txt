To do:

- Remove dependency on steam-client and remove ability to specify a custom one. Instead, build that functionality in directly.
- Update any dependencies that are pinned to an outdated major version
- Add promise support for all methods that take a callback
    - **This is not happening.** There is no way to do promises alongside callbacks with first-party Promises, and I'm
      not interested in using something third-party to do promises.

Breaking:

- Now requires node 6 (up from node 4)
- Removed deprecated and non-functional method `disableTwoFactor`; use [steamcommunity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamcommunity) instead
- Removed deprecated method `generateAuthCode`; use [steam-totp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) instead
- `server_time` in enableTwoFactor callback data is now a number instead of a string (not a Date as that would break the JSON-stringifyable property of the response)
- Callbacks now have `err` as their first argument
    - enableTwoFactor
    - createAccount (changed from eresult)
    - requestValidationEmail (changed from eresult)
    - getSteamGuardDetails
    - getCredentialChangeTimes
    - getAuthSecret
    - getPlayerCount (changed from eresult)
    - getProductChanges
    - getProductInfo
    - getProductAccessToken
    - redeemKey (changed from eresult)
    - getChatHistory (changed from eresult)
    - blockUser (changed from eresult)
    - unblockUser (changed from eresult)
    - getPersonas
    - getSteamLevels
    - getGameBadgeLevel
    - getServerList
    - getServerSteamIDsByIP
    - getServerIPsBySteamID
- Removed legacy support for secret questions and answers to createAccount

Before publishing:

- Create v3 branch pointing to last v3 release
